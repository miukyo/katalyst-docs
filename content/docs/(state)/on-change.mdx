description: Subscribing to state changes
---

## Overview

Use `state:onChange(fn)` to subscribe to changes. The returned connection has a `Disconnect()` method.

```lua
local State = Katalyst.State

local s = State(0)
local conn = s:onChange(function(newVal)
  print("new val", newVal)
end)

-- later
conn:Disconnect()
```

Notes

- Subscriptions are fired asynchronously (batched) via `task.defer`.
