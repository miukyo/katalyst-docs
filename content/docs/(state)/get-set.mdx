title: Get & Set
description: Read and write Katalyst State
---

## Overview

Create state using `Katalyst.State(initial)`. Read with `:get()` and write with `:set(value)`.

```lua
local State = Katalyst.State

local s = State({ x = 1 })
print(s:get().x)
s:set({ x = 2 })
```

Notes

- `:set()` schedules a batched notification via a small internal queue (so multiple sets in the same tick only fire subscribers once).
- When setting tables, Katalyst performs a deep equality check to avoid unnecessary updates.
