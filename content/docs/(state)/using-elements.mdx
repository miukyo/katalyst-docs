description: How to bind State to element props and computed props
---

## Overview

Bind state directly to props by passing the `State` object or using computed functions that read `:get()`.

```lua
local State = Katalyst.State
local New = Katalyst.New

local count = State(0)

local label = New("TextLabel")({
  Text = function()
    return "Count: " .. count:get()
  end,
})

-- or bind the State directly
local label2 = New("TextLabel")({
  Text = count,
})
```

Notes

- When passing a `State` directly, the instance property is set to the state's current value and will update as the state changes.
