description: How to preview Katalyst components with Hoarcekat
---

## Overview

Katalyst works well with Hoarcekat for component previewing. Because Katalyst returns real Instances, you can return a Katalyst component from a story and set its `Parent` to the story's target.

Example story:

```lua
-- story.lua
local Katalyst = require("Katalyst")
local New = Katalyst.New

local label = New("TextLabel")({
  Text = "Hello from Katalyst",
})

return function(target)
  label.Parent = target
end
```

Or return a factory:

```lua
return function(target)
  local Label = New("TextLabel")({ Text = "Hello from Katalyst" })
  Label.Parent = target
end
```

Notes

- Because the runtime uses real Instances, Hoarcekat's live previewing works without additional adapters.
