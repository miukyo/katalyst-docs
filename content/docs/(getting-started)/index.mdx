description: How to include Katalyst in your Roblox project
---

## Overview

Katalyst is intentionally tiny. There are a few ways to include it in your project:

1. Import the module into your `ReplicatedStorage` and `require` it.
2. Add it as a module in your asset pipeline (Rojo / other bundlers) and require the module by path.

Example (require local module):

```lua
-- In a ModuleScript named Katalyst
local Katalyst = require(path.to.Katalyst)
local New = Katalyst.New
```

Notes

- The runtime is a single file and safe to vend into multiple projects.

## Download
