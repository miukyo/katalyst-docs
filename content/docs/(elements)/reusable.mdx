title: Reusable Component
description: Creating reusable components with Katalyst
---

## Overview

You can create small reusable components by writing functions that return Katalyst elements. Because `New` returns real Instances, the same usability rules apply as with direct Instances.

Example

```lua
local New = Katalyst.New

local function Badge(text)
  return New("Frame")({
    Children = {
      New("TextLabel")({ Text = text }),
    }
  })
end

local badge = Badge("New")

-- badge is a proxy; set parent like a normal Instance
badge.Parent = game.Players.LocalPlayer:WaitForChild("PlayerGui")
```

Notes

- For components that need state, keep State objects inside the component function or accept them as props.
