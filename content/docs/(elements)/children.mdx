description: Declarative children handling

## Overview

`Children` accepts arrays, nested arrays (fragments), functions (computed children), and `State` that resolves to an array. Katalyst diffs children and attaches/detaches Instances efficiently.

Example

```lua
local New = Katalyst.New
local Map = Katalyst.Map

local items = {"A","B","C"}

local list = New("Frame")({
  Children = {
    New("UIListLayout")({}),
    Map(items, function(item,i)
      return New("TextLabel")({ Text = i..". "..item })
    end),
  }
})
```

Notes

- Katalyst sets `LayoutOrder` automatically for GuiObjects when attaching.
- When a parent is destroyed, the weak-keyed cache is cleaned up.
