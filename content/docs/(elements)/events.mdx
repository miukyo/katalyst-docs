## Overview

Katalyst maps props that start with `On` to Roblox events and calls your handler with the proxy as the first argument.

Example

```lua
local New = Katalyst.New

local btn = New("TextButton")({
  Text = "Click me",
  OnActivated = function(self)
    self.Text = "Clicked"
  end,
})

-- use raw instance
btn.OnEnter = function(self)
  local inst = self()
  inst.BackgroundTransparency = 0.5
end
```

### Possible events

Below is a non-exhaustive mapping of common Katalyst `On*` prop names to Roblox events. When you set these props on a Katalyst element, the runtime connects the corresponding Roblox event and calls your handler with the proxy as the first argument.

- OnActivated → Activated (GuiButton)
- OnDown → MouseButton1Down (GuiButton)
- OnUp → MouseButton1Up (GuiButton)
- OnEnter → MouseEnter (GuiObject)
- OnLeave → MouseLeave (GuiObject)

Notes

- Katalyst wires common event names that start with `On`. If you need to connect to a Roblox event not listed here, you can get the raw Instance using `proxy()` and connect manually *(see the example below)*.
- Event handlers receive the proxy as the first argument. Use `self()` to access the raw Instance when needed.
- Avoid heavy work directly in event handlers; debounce or yield when necessary.

### Connecting events in `Ref`

You can also connect directly to Roblox events inside the `Ref` callback — this is useful when you need access to the raw Instance for advanced event handling or when you want to return a cleanup function that disconnects the events automatically.

Example:

```lua
local New = Katalyst.New

local button = New("TextBox")({
  Ref = function(self)
    local conn = self.Changed:Connect(function()
      print(self.Text)
    end)

    -- return cleanup to disconnect when the Instance is destroyed
    return function()
      conn:Disconnect()
    end
  end,
})
```
